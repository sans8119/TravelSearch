Search for destinations

Travel-search-App

This is the first version of the app.

Theme:
When ever a user enters any text in the from or to textboxes, a search is initiated in the cloud. After the results 
are obtained , they fall from the cloud as rain drops. The rain drops fall on the floor. The floor can be seen as
flooring ceramic tiles in the boottom portion of app screen. When the rain drops fall they splash and as many droplets
as there are search results are formed. These drops like rain drops are circular and magnify the area beneath them.
When user touches on any of the raindrop the corresponding text box is filled with text.

Things to do: 1) Create clouds and their movement all in code withoug using images. It should look exactly like a sky 
having moving clouds. 2) Make water droplets which have fallen on floor exactly like the rain drops on a leaf of floor. 
Give a shine only to the part of the drop and give it a 3d look and feel. 3) use SurfaceView instead of view.
This will make the ui much more responsive.
